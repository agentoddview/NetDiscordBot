1403439257065885771,Denied,"Thank you for taking the time to submit your application and for expressing interest in joining the team. We appreciate your effort and the qualities you mentioned, such as empathy, honesty, and integrity — all of which are valuable traits for any staff member.

After reviewing your application, we’ve decided not to move forward at this time. Many of your responses were very short and lacked the level of detail we look for when evaluating candidates. Your answers didn’t provide enough background or explanation for us to fully understand your goals, experience, or how you would handle various staff situations. When applying, it’s important to give full, thought-out responses that show both your understanding of the role and how you would contribute to the team.

We did appreciate that you mentioned reporting Supervisor issues to a Lead Supervisor — that’s the correct action and shows a good sense of responsibility. However, overall, your responses need more depth, structure, and clarity. We also recommend working on spelling and grammar to improve communication, as this is an important part of being a staff member.

We encourage you to take some time to better familiarize yourself with how our staff team operates, provide more detailed answers, and reapply when you feel ready. With more effort and explanation, you could be a stronger candidate in the future."

1272588390944215052,Denied,"Thank you for taking the time to apply and for expressing interest in joining the New England Transit staff team. We appreciate your effort and the experience you’ve shared from other communities.

After reviewing your application, we’ve decided not to move forward at this time. While your responses showed enthusiasm and prior staff experience, many of your answers lacked the depth and structure we look for in successful applications. A number of responses were focused more on personal details or general statements rather than directly addressing how you would handle specific staff duties or situations here at NET.

We also recommend focusing on providing clearer, more concise answers in the future, as communication and professionalism are key parts of the Supervisor role. Additionally, while it’s great that you were invited by a current staff member, we’d like to see more emphasis on your own motivations for joining the team rather than being influenced by others.

That said, you clearly understand basic moderation concepts such as professionalism, escalation, and fairness — which is a great foundation. With more attention to detail, stronger explanations, and a clearer understanding of our team’s expectations, you could be a stronger candidate in the future.

We encourage you to take some time to improve your application quality and reapply when you feel ready. Thank you again for your interest and continued support of New England Transit."

1144998506801664082,Denied,"Thank you for taking the time to apply for a position on the New England Transit staff team. We appreciate the effort you put into your responses and your clear motivation to support the community.

After reviewing your application, we’ve decided not to move forward at this time. While your answers showed dedication and professionalism, much of your application focused on general traits and experiences rather than providing clear, detailed examples of how you would apply those skills within our team. Some responses also repeated similar points instead of offering specific insight into your moderation approach or understanding of NET operations.

We also recommend working on clarity and structure in your answers — well-organized, to-the-point responses help us better understand your thought process and readiness for staff responsibilities. Additionally, since you are still fairly new to the server, we suggest spending more time engaging with the community to build familiarity with how we operate day-to-day.

That said, your professionalism, calm attitude toward handling issues, and awareness of how to report abuse of power are all strong points that could make you a better candidate in the future. With more experience in our environment and deeper, more situational responses, you’re encouraged to reapply later on.

Thank you again for your interest and time — we wish you the best moving forward."
1126987505913307278,Denied,"Thank you for taking the time to apply for a position on the New England Transit staff team. We appreciate the detail and effort you put into your responses, as well as your enthusiasm for Ro-Transit and transit operations in general.

After reviewing your application, we’ve decided not to move forward at this time. While your answers showed a genuine interest in the community, many of your responses focused more on personal passion for transit rather than demonstrating clear staff-related experience or an understanding of how to handle in-game or community situations. Additionally, activity concerns due to college commitments and some vague responses made it difficult to fully assess your readiness for the position.

We encourage you to spend more time becoming familiar with the server’s operations and expectations before reapplying. Once you’ve gained more hands-on experience and can provide detailed, scenario-based examples in your answers, you’re welcome to apply again in the future.

Thank you again for your interest and enthusiasm — we appreciate your support for NE Transit and wish you the best going forward."

Additionally, your responses lacked the level of depth and professionalism we look for in successful candidates.

We encourage you to continue being active in the community, gain more hands-on experience, and observe how our current supervisors handle situations. Once you’ve had more time to develop your leadership and communication skills in the server environment, you’re welcome to reapply in the future.

Your answers show genuine passion for the group and a strong appreciation for what we do. It’s clear that you have a solid understanding of our community and take the role seriously, which is exactly what we look for in new staff members.

After reviewing your responses, we’ve decided not to move forward with your application at this time. While it’s clear you have prior experience and enthusiasm for moderation, your application raised some concerns — particularly regarding professionalism and maturity. The mention of past conflicts, including your previous termination and recent arguments in other communities, suggests that further growth in conflict management and emotional control may be needed before rejoining the team.

We encourage you to stay active in the community and demonstrate positive behavior and professionalism over time. Continued improvement in communication and calmness under pressure will greatly strengthen any future application.
