gameglicher20,Accepted,"Thank you for your application. After reviewing your responses, I am pleased to let you know that you are moving forward in the process. Your answers, while sometimes lacking in sentence length, still showed good understanding and provided solid information about the role. I was especially impressed by the background you shared from your experience in the school bus game, as it highlights valuable moderation skills. It is also great to see that you emphasized getting permission before taking moderative actions on users — this shows maturity, responsibility, and professionalism. Overall, you seem to have a strong understanding of how our team operates and how you can contribute positively. I believe you will be a good fit and I look forward to seeing how you progress in the next stage."
powerful_possum_08801,Denied,"Thank you for your interest in applying for New England Transit. After reviewing your application, we have decided not to progress it further. The main reasons for this decision are that your application contained frequent spelling and grammar errors, your responses were very short, and the overall answers did not show the level of dedication we are looking for. Stronger applications usually demonstrate more care, effort, and detail. For future applications, I encourage you to use a spell checker or proofreading tool, take time to expand your answers with clear detail, and ensure your submission reflects genuine effort and commitment to the role. We do appreciate the time you took to apply and wish you the best in developing stronger applications and finding the right opportunity. Failed Stage 1.-"
noah_devsrbx,Denied,"Thank you for your application and the effort you put into it. After reviewing your responses, we have decided not to progress your application at this time. Your answers showed that you have the right idea and a solid understanding of the basics, but many of your responses were too short and lacked the depth we look for. We would have liked to see you be more specific about your background, how you believe you can improve the group, what you think the role is about, and how being hired could contribute to further improvements. Strong applications not only provide the right ideas but also expand on them with examples, outcomes, and what could happen next. This level of detail helps us better understand your skills, motivation, and the value you would bring to the team. For future applications, I encourage you to build on your strong foundation by writing fuller sentences, adding more specific details, and explaining your ideas in greater depth. Doing so will make your application much stronger and more competitive. Thank you again for applying, and we wish you the best in developing your responses for future opportunities. Failed Stage 1."
mr_godoy2008,Denied,"Thank you for your application and for taking the time to apply. After reviewing your responses, we have decided not to move forward with your application. The answers you provided were very limited and lacked the depth we look for in candidates. Your responses came across as bland and did not give us much information about your background or how committed you are to the role. Strong applications usually demonstrate clear effort, enthusiasm, and detailed explanations that help us understand a candidate’s suitability. For future applications, I recommend taking more time to expand on your answers, explain your skills and experiences, and show genuine motivation for the position. This will help your application stand out and demonstrate your commitment. We appreciate the effort you made in applying and wish you the best in strengthening your future applications. Failed Stage 1."
deywon100,Denied,"Thank you for taking the time to apply. After reviewing your application, we have decided not to move forward with it at this time. While you provided some good responses, there were several areas that held your application back. A major concern was the lack of spelling, punctuation, and grammar throughout your answers. Strong SPaG is essential for a Supervising role, as clear and professional communication is necessary when working with both players and staff. Without this, it may come across as unprofessional. Some of your responses also lacked detail and did not show the level of dedication we look for in applicants. In future applications, please expand on your answers to better demonstrate your motivation and commitment. Additionally, your responses showed some misunderstanding of how our game operates. To clarify: our game is a Free Drive, not a Trained Drive. Drivers are free to choose their own routes in public servers, and routes are only assigned during shifts. We do not “warn” or “write up” players for not being on time while operating their route. It’s important for applicants to have a clear understanding of these systems before applying. We encourage you to work on improving your SPaG, expand your answers with more detail, and gain a stronger understanding of how the game functions. Doing so will give you a much stronger chance of success in the future. Thank you again for your application, and we wish you the best going forward. Failed Stage 1."
saltandpepper0353,Denied,"Thank you for your interest in the position and for taking the time to apply. After careful consideration, we have decided not to move your application forward. The main reasons for this decision are that your responses lacked the detail and background we need to properly assess your suitability for the role. Your answers were too brief, and they did not give us a clear picture of your experience, skills, or motivation. In addition, we noticed that your application included a statement about using admin against someone. This comes across as unprofessional and does not reflect the kind of attitude we look for in candidates. Professionalism, respect, and constructive communication are key qualities we expect from all applicants. For future applications, we recommend expanding on your answers with more detail and providing specific examples of your experience. It’s also important to maintain a professional tone throughout your application, as this demonstrates the right mindset for any role. We appreciate the time you spent applying and wish you the best in improving your applications and pursuing future opportunities. Failed Stage 1."
xgh04t,Accepted,"Thank you for your application. After reviewing your responses, I’m pleased to let you know that you have progressed to the next stage of the process. Your answers were strong and showed a good level of thought and effort. You provided professional examples and demonstrated relevant experience, which suggests you could be a good fit for this role. While your responses were solid, there are areas where adding more detail would help us get an even clearer picture of your skills and approach. Expanding further on your examples and providing a little more depth would make your application even stronger. We look forward to seeing how you continue to develop through the next stage and encourage you to keep building on the strong foundation you’ve already shown."
christienrc,Accepted,"After reviewing your application, we are pleased to inform you that it has been accepted. Your consistent activity within NE Transit, combined with your clear motivation to assist the community and create a more welcoming environment, stood out strongly. Even without prior administrative experience, you demonstrated a solid understanding of what professionalism, self-control, and fairness look like in practice. Your answers showed maturity, especially in how you would document and escalate issues instead of acting beyond your authority. Additionally, your high level of activity and willingness to dedicate time to the group makes you a reliable candidate. While you have had a past suspension, you acknowledged it openly and showed that you’ve learned from the experience, which reflects accountability and growth. Overall, your dedication, maturity, and clear focus on professionalism made your application a strong fit for this position. We look forward to seeing you contribute as part of the team."
kaden_188,Denied,"Thank you for your interest in the position and for submitting your application. After reviewing your responses, we have decided not to move forward with your application. The answers you provided were very minimal and did not give us enough information to properly assess your background, skills, or motivation. In addition, the lack of detail suggested a low level of commitment to the process. Strong applications usually demonstrate genuine effort, with thoughtful and complete responses that reflect both interest and dedication to the role. For future applications, I encourage you to take more time to expand your answers, explain your experiences in greater detail, and show clear enthusiasm for the opportunity. This will greatly improve how your application is received. We appreciate the time you took to apply and wish you the best in strengthening your future applications. Failed Stage 1."
blud_hi,Accepted,"Thank you for your application. After reviewing your responses, I am pleased to inform you that you have been accepted to progress to Stage 2 of the process. Your answers were strong, with good effort and well-sized paragraphs that showed clear thought. You also demonstrated some promising qualities that suggest you could be a good fit for the role. There are, however, areas where you can improve. Your grammar and spelling need more attention, as professional communication is an important part of this role. I also encourage you to continue learning our guidelines more thoroughly if your hired. It’s important to understand that bans must follow our disciplinary process — for example: Warning → Kick → Ban — rather than banning someone immediately for a minimal action. Rules must always be applied fairly and proportionately. With improvement in these areas, I believe you will do well moving forward. We look forward to seeing how you perform in Stage 2 and encourage you to keep building on the strong foundation you’ve shown so far."
epic_joshua,Denied,"Thank you for taking the time to apply. We appreciate the effort you put into your responses, and overall your answers were thoughtful. However, at this time, we will not be moving forward with your application. Your answers showed good potential, but they were missing some important details we expect in staff applications. For example, in your response about a Supervisor abusing power, you mentioned that you would warn the Supervisor. While that shows awareness, in our procedures, situations like that should be escalated to a higher-up such as a Senior Supervisor or Lead Supervisor immediately. Additionally, regarding unreleased buses, it’s fine for Supervisors to spawn them as long as they do not allow non-staff to drive them without HR’s permission. Also, while you noted punishing traffic law violations, we are not very strict about that compared to other issues we handle, so that part did not fully align with how we operate. Another area to improve on is sentence structure. Many of your answers were good but felt incomplete. In the future, try to use full sentences and provide a bit more explanation in your answers. Taking some time to better understand how our staff team works will also help strengthen your application. We encourage you to reapply in the future once you’ve had time to review and improve on these points. Thank you again for applying, and we hope to see another application from you down the line. Failed Stage 1."
lvvsjon,Accepted,"Thank you for submitting your application for the Supervisor position. After reviewing your responses, we are pleased to let you know that you have passed the first stage and will be moving forward to the interview process. Your experience, activity level, and commitment to the community stood out, and we look forward to learning more about you in the interview. Further details and scheduling instructions will be shared with you soon—congratulations on making it to the next step!"
oneway1233457,Denied,"Thank you for taking the time to apply. After reviewing your application, we’ve decided not to move forward at this time. One of the main issues we noticed was that many of your responses were very short and lacked detail, especially in explaining why you want to join the team. Providing more complete and thoughtful answers helps us better understand your goals and fit for the position. We also noticed several spelling and grammar issues. While this isn’t the most important factor, clear communication is a big part of being on the staff team, so improving in that area will definitely help in the future. Another important requirement is having a working microphone. Since you stated that you only use chat, we recommend getting a microphone before reapplying, as voice communication is necessary for this role. On the positive side, you do have a decent understanding of moderation basics. However, we’d like to see more focus on using warnings and progressive discipline, rather than immediately resorting to timeouts. We encourage you to work on these areas and reapply when you feel ready. With some improvements, you could definitely be a stronger candidate in the future. Failed Stage 1."
hers4everluvsss,Denied,"Thank you for submitting your application. After reviewing it, we’ve decided not to move forward at this time. Many of your responses were very short and lacked the detail we look for in applications. For example, simply saying that you believe the role is great does not give us much information about who you are or why you would like to be part of the team. We recommend adding more background about yourself and more depth in your answers so we can better understand your motivations and suitability for the position. In one of your answers about a Supervisor abusing power, it would have been better to mention reporting it directly to a higher-up such as the Chief of Staff through the ticket system. That’s the proper way to handle a situation like that. On a positive note, we did like that you mentioned giving three warnings before taking further action. That shows a good understanding of moderation and a fair approach to handling issues. Overall, you seem to have a decent grasp of how to moderate, but we would like to see more detailed responses and stronger explanations in future applications. We encourage you to reapply once you’ve had time to expand on your answers and add more depth. Thank you again for applying, and we look forward to seeing a stronger application from you in the future. Failed Stage 1."
idrinkbabyoil,Denied,"Thank you for submitting your application and taking the time to apply. After reviewing your responses, we have decided not to move forward with your application at this time. The main concern was that your background information was very minimal, and your answers did not explain how you believe you could improve the team. Many of your sentences were short and lacked the detail we look for in candidates. Stronger applications usually include clear explanations of why the applicant wants to join the team, how they can contribute to making it better, and what they would do in the role to succeed. For future applications, I encourage you to expand more on your answers by including detail about your skills, experiences, and motivation. Be specific about how you would approach the responsibilities of the job, why you believe you are a good fit, and the positive impact you think you could make. With more detail and clearer explanations, your application will stand out much more. We appreciate the time you took to apply, and we wish you the best in improving your responses for future opportunities."
misdescribe,Denied,"Thank you for submitting your application and for sharing your interest in becoming part of the team. After review, we have decided not to move forward with your candidacy at this time. The main reasons are that your current availability and limited access to a working PC would make it difficult to meet the activity and reliability expectations of the role, and we also noticed areas where your responses could have been more polished and professional to meet the standards required for this position. We appreciate the passion and experience you bring to the community, and we encourage you to stay active, continue building your skills, and reapply in the future when your availability and setup allow you to fully take on the responsibilities of the position."
signalsixty,Accepted,"I am very pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted. Your responses were absolutely outstanding — your writing was detailed, clear, and professional throughout. You demonstrated a strong background and experience that stood out from the very beginning. The level of effort and thought you put into your application shows real dedication, and your views for the team align perfectly with what we are looking for in a Supervisor. I believe you will be an excellent addition to the team, and I am excited to see the positive impact you will bring. We look forward to seeing where your career takes you here, and I am confident you will achieve great things with us."
trenoe464,Accepted,"Thank you for your application and the time you put into writing it. After reviewing your responses, we are pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted. Your answers show a genuine passion for the game, especially in how you want to support new players, host shifts, and contribute positively to the community. We were also impressed by your prior experience as a developer and supervisor in other Roblox games, which shows that you already have leadership and moderation skills that will be valuable here. We also appreciate your emphasis on respect, professionalism, and teamwork. The fact that you highlighted leading by example and treating players fairly reflects the values we expect from our supervisors. Your willingness to gather evidence before escalating issues also shows a thoughtful and responsible approach to handling situations. Overall, you demonstrated a clear understanding of what it means to be part of the team and a strong motivation to help the community grow. We believe you will be a great fit for our staff team."

zion1221c_04488,Denied,"Thank you for taking the time to apply. After reviewing your application, unfortunately, it has been denied at this time. Your responses showed some effort, but overall they were too minimal and lacked the detail we expect from applicants. Many answers were only one short sentence and did not fully explain your background, how you believe you could improve the team, or what you think the role of a Supervisor truly involves. This level of detail is important, as supervisors need to clearly communicate their ideas and demonstrate their understanding of the position. Another major concern is the lack of Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar (SPaG) throughout your application. Professional communication is a big part of supervising, and without strong SPaG it becomes difficult to present yourself professionally in front of players and the team. Finally, your answers suggest a limited understanding of what supervising actually means. Supervisors are expected to lead by example, follow the guidelines we set, and handle situations with professionalism and fairness. Your responses did not show enough of that knowledge. We encourage you to continue gaining experience, improving your communication, and learning more about our guidelines. With more detail, stronger professionalism, and a better understanding of the role, we believe you could be a stronger candidate in the future."

blue._1vy,Accepted,"Thank you for taking the time to apply. After reviewing your application, I am pleased to let you know that it has been accepted to move forward. Your responses show a strong level of detail, professionalism, and dedication. You provided thoughtful answers that demonstrate a clear understanding of what it means to be a Supervisor and how to handle situations responsibly. I was especially impressed by the way you connected your passion for transportation to both Roblox and real-life experience, as well as your past roles in similar positions. This shows that you already have a solid background in leadership and management. Your application also highlights strong communication skills and maturity, which are essential for this position. While there are still areas where you can improve, such as continuing to strengthen your grammar and polishing sentence structure, your overall responses show that you are capable of performing the role and representing the team professionally. We believe that your experience, dedication, and motivation will make you a great fit for our Supervisor team. I look forward to seeing how you grow in this role and how your contributions will benefit both the players and the community."
ant_manikin94,Accepted,"Thank you for your application and the time you took to submit it. After reviewing your responses, unfortunately, your application has been denied at this time. The main reason for this decision is that your answers were very minimal and lacked the detail we are looking for. Many of your responses were only a few words or short phrases, which does not provide enough background for us to properly understand your experience, dedication, or how you would handle responsibilities as a Supervisor. A strong application should explain your past experiences, how you would improve the team, and how you plan to approach different situations in detail. Additionally, some of your answers show a limited understanding of the role and its expectations. For example, when asked how you would handle issues, your responses were vague and did not demonstrate the level of professionalism and problem-solving we expect from our team members. To succeed in this role, it is important to provide clear explanations, outcomes, and reasoning behind your decisions. We encourage you to work on providing more detailed responses, improving your writing, and showing a stronger understanding of Supervising responsibilities. With more effort and preparation, we believe you could be a stronger candidate in the future."
.lilmari.,Accepted,"Thank you for your application and the time you took to provide such a thorough and detailed response. After reviewing your submission, I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted. Your application stood out because of the clear dedication, professionalism, and experience you bring to the table. You demonstrated strong writing skills with detailed explanations, showing not only your understanding of the role but also how you intend to contribute to the success and growth of NE Transit. Your prior experience in multiple transit groups, including roles such as Trainer and Transit Police Officer, highlights your ability to handle responsibility, maintain professionalism, and enforce rules effectively. What we valued most was your perspective on communication, organization, and leadership. You made it clear that you see administration as more than just control—it’s about guidance, teamwork, and creating a positive community. This aligns perfectly with the values we want to reinforce within our team. Your focus on de-escalating situations calmly and maintaining professionalism shows us that you are well-prepared for challenges that come with being a Supervisor. While you mentioned some limitations in terms of your current setup, your strengths in activity, communication, respect, and experience far outweigh those concerns. We believe your enthusiasm and dedication will make you a strong addition to the Supervisor team, and we are excited to see how you help shape the future of NE Transit."

Additionally, your responses showed limited understanding of the role. For example, answers such as “Idk” or very short statements do not demonstrate the level of professionalism and dedication that is required for this position. Supervisors must show strong communication skills, provide clear explanations, and be able to outline how they would handle different scenarios in detail. We encourage you to work on expanding your answers, providing more background on your experience, and improving your grammar and professionalism in your writing. With more effort and preparation, we believe you could be a stronger candidate in the future."
l_xyz,Denied,"After reviewing your application, we have decided to deny it at this time. While you showed enthusiasm for helping NE Transit and highlighted past moderation experience, there were several concerns that led to this decision. Your application referenced a prior blacklist for inappropriate language, which raises concerns about judgment and professionalism. Additionally, you mentioned that you can become easily angered and have a history of starting arguments, which could create challenges in maintaining a calm and respectful environment for both players and staff. Professionalism, reliability, and emotional control are key requirements for this role, and we feel that these areas need more development before you can be considered for staff. We encourage you to remain active in the community, continue building positive interactions, and demonstrate growth over time. Doing so may allow you to reapply in the future with stronger qualifications."

After a full review of your responses, I regret to inform you that your application has been denied at this time. While you did provide some relevant experience from other groups, your application lacked the level of professionalism and detail we expect from Supervisor candidates. Many of your responses were general and did not go in-depth about how you would specifically contribute to NE Transit, improve the team, or handle the responsibilities of the position. We are looking for applicants who can clearly explain their leadership style, conflict resolution methods, and long-term goals for the group. Another concern was your reasoning for applying. You mentioned the role being a “good job that pays well in Robux,” which shows a misunderstanding of the position and its purpose. Our Supervisor team is about professionalism, leadership, and supporting the community, not financial incentive. This response raised concerns about your dedication to the role and the values we expect our Supervisors to uphold. We encourage you to work on providing more detailed, thoughtful answers in future applications, and to focus more on how you can contribute to the success and professionalism of NE Transit rather than personal gain. With improvement in these areas, you may be a strong candidate in the future. Thank you again for applying, and we wish you the best moving forward."

After reviewing your submission, I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted. Your passion for NE Transit stood out clearly throughout your application. You demonstrated not only a love for public transportation and the community we are building here, but also a genuine dedication to helping it thrive. We greatly value applicants who care deeply about the group and want to contribute positively to its growth, and your words reflected that commitment. We also appreciated the balance you showed between enthusiasm and responsibility. Your perspective on what it means to be an administrator—avoiding power abuse, knowing the community, and simply being yourself—aligns well with the values we strive to uphold in our Supervisor team. Additionally, your prior leadership experience within Roblox, combined with your quick-learning mindset, shows that you have the ability to adapt, take on responsibility, and handle situations effectively. Another strength we saw in your application was your clear approach to conflict resolution. Your step-by-step method of giving warnings and escalating only when necessary demonstrates a fair and professional mindset, which is essential for maintaining a positive and respectful environment. Even when mentioning your personal challenges, you showed strong self-awareness and an ability to stay focused on what you truly care about—qualities that will serve you well as a Supervisor. We are confident that your dedication, energy, and thoughtful approach will make you a valuable addition to the NE Transit team.

somazzo,Denied,"Thank you for taking the time to submit your application to NE Transit. After carefully reviewing your responses, I regret to inform you that your application has been denied at this time. While you expressed enthusiasm for making the game fair and enjoyable, your application did not meet the level of detail and professionalism we are looking for in a Supervisor. Many of your answers were very brief and lacked clear explanations of how you would handle responsibilities or contribute to the success of the team. The Supervisor role requires strong communication, leadership, and problem-solving skills, which were not clearly demonstrated in your responses. Another concern is past conduct. You mentioned being banned from another group due to repeatedly breaking rules. Professionalism and rule-following are critical qualities we expect from all Supervisors, and this raises questions about reliability and consistency in upholding our standards. We also noted that in several areas of your application, your responses focused on very general ideas rather than concrete examples of how you would handle specific challenges as a Supervisor. This made it difficult to evaluate your readiness for the position. We encourage you to continue gaining experience, working on professionalism, and providing more detailed, thoughtful responses in future applications. With improvement in these areas, you may become a stronger candidate moving forward. Thank you again for applying, and we wish you the best in your continued involvement with NE Transit."
gleehay,Denied,"Thank you for taking the time to submit your application to NE Transit.

While your enthusiasm for public transportation and your interest in NE Transit are clear, your application did not demonstrate the level of experience and professionalism we are looking for in a Supervisor. One of the main concerns was the lack of prior moderation or leadership experience within Roblox transit groups, which is a key factor in ensuring candidates are prepared for the responsibilities of this role. Additionally, although your responses showed effort, many of them lacked the depth and detail we expect. Supervisors are required to make important decisions, communicate effectively, and serve as role models for the community. At this time, your answers did not provide enough evidence of how you would meet those expectations. We also noted your own acknowledgment of being very young and still limited in certain areas, such as bus operation knowledge and activity. These are important considerations, as this position requires maturity, responsibility, and a strong understanding of transit systems in order to lead effectively. We encourage you to continue developing your skills, gaining more experience in community moderation, and building knowledge of transit operations. With growth in these areas, we believe you could become a stronger candidate in the future. Thank you again for your interest in NE Transit, and we wish you the best moving forward."
